    "# Assignment 1: Perceptron Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to apply the perceptron learning to a total of $N=100$ automatically generated, separable random data $X=\\bigl\\{\\vec x^1, \\vec x^2,\\ldots,\\vec x^ N \\bigr\\}$ with each $\\vec x^n = \\bigl(x_1^n, x_2^n\\bigr)^T$.\n",
    "Each data point $\\vec x^n$ is accompanied by an according target value $X=\\bigl\\{t^1, t^2,\\ldots,t^ N\\bigr\\}$ with $t^n \\in \\{-1,+1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Generation\n",
    "The data should be generated such that\n",
    "$\\forall n\\leq\\frac N2\\colon \\vec x^n \\sim \\mathcal N_{\\vec\\mu_+, \\sigma_+}$.\n",
    "These samples will be our positive data labeled with $t^n=1$.\n",
    "Similarly, we generate our negative data with\n",
    "$\\forall n>\\frac N2\\colon \\vec x^n \\sim \\mathcal N_{\\vec\\mu_-, \\sigma_-}$\n",
    "and label them as $t^n=-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Data Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the number of samples and the means (mu) and standard deviations (sigma) of positive (pos) and negative (neg) data, generate and return data samples including their labels. Remember to add the bias neuron $x_0=1$ to each of the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. Use `numpy` package to generate data.\n",
    "2. Exemplary means could be selected as: $\\vec\\mu_+=(-5,3)^T$ and $\\vec\\mu_- = (5, -3)^T$. The standard deviations $\\sigma_+$ and $\\sigma_-$ should be selected such that the data is most likely separable."
