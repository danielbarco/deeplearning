        "In this assignment, we develop a network that is capable of correctly classifying known classes while at the same time rejecting unknown samples that occur during inference time.\n",
        "To showcase the capability, we make use of the MNIST dataset that we artificially split into known, negative and unknown classes; this allows us to train a network on the data without requiring too expensive hardware.\n",

        "The `\"train\"` partition uses the training samples of the *known* and the *negative* classes.\n",
        "The `\"validation\"` partition uses the test samples of the *known* and the *negative* classes.\n",
